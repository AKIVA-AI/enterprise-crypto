Enterprise Crypto - Exchange Registration Script

Run this before starting the trading bot to enable Coinbase Futures support.

Usage:
    python -c "from user_data.exchanges.register_exchanges import register; register()"
    
Or import at the start of your strategy:
    from user_data.exchanges.register_exchanges import register
    register()
